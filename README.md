For this project, I explored the FiveThirtyEight "Flying Etiquette" dataset. I chose the question:  
**"Do people think it’s rude to ask someone to switch seats with you in order to be closer to family?"**

I picked this question because it reflects a common dilemma travelers face, and I was curious how opinions might vary. What stood out was how overwhelmingly people responded that it's **not rude**—suggesting that many people are understanding when it comes to family needs on flights.

The chart below shows that **705 people** said it’s not rude, while **only 145** total said it was either “somewhat rude” or “very rude.” This reveals a general sense of empathy or flexibility among passengers when seating requests involve family.
